# Tomatoes clock

**[Visit Online App](https://aleetsaiya.github.io/tomatoes-clock/)**

## Intro
This is my first Front-End side-project with html、css and Javascript when I was in college. This app has two main functions:

1) Todo-list
2) Countdown timmer

## Feature
I try to use `localstorage` to store the data that the user input and make a Fade-in Fade-out animation when the user switches to a different page.
